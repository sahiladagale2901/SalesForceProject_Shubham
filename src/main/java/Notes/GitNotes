Git is a Version Control System (VCS)


1. You can go back to previous versions if something breaks.
2. You can work on new features without affecting the main project.
3. You can collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s work.


What is GitHub:
                    GitHub is an online platform that hosts your Git repositories on the cloud —
so you can store, share, and collaborate with others easily.
